To make the website's download functionality work, we should keep the .exe file in the same folder.
I tried to store the .exe file and push it to the GitHub repo,
but GitHub's file push size limit is 100MB, and the .exe file is 108MB.

So, if you want the download functionality to work,
install the .exe file from the website and name it as 'ue_english.exe',
and store it inside ths folder.
