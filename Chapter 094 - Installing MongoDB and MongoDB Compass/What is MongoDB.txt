What exactly is MongoDB?

NoSQL like mySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL store data in a fixed structure.
SQL like MongoDB, Firebase, Cassandra store data in a non-fixed structure.

MongoDB is used in web development because it is built for this shit.
NoSQL wants our app to adapt to its storing structure with rigid rules.
But, SQL like MongoDB makes the storing structure adapt to our app.

MongoDB is best for fast-evolving applications, which required changes every now and then.

But for heavily secure systems like banking systems, money transactions, NoSQL is prefered because of it's fixed data storing structure.
