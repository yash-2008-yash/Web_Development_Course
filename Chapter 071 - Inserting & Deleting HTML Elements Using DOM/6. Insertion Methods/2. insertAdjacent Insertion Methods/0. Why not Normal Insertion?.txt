Normal insertion is good, but it has one flaw in it.

document.body.append("<h1>Hello, World!</h1>")

You might think that this'll add a new h1 tag into the end of the body.
Nah! It just adds a plain text saying <h1>Hello, World!</h1>.

But, with insertAdjacent methods, we can insert actual elements, not just plain text.

And, that's why we are learning 'insertAdjacent' methods now.
