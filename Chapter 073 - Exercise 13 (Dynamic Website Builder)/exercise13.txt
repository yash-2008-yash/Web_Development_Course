EXERCISE 13

In this exercise, we should create a dynamic website builder.

NOTE: Use card.png as reference.

We should create a JS function which takes the following arguments:
    i. Title of the video
    ii. Duration of the video
    iii. Channel Name
    iv. Views
    v. The months it has been since the video released
    vi. Video Thumbnail

NOTE: 'Views' should be an integer.
If the value is 13000, it should be shown as 13K.

When we give inputs, it should build an exact copy like card.png with the given inputs.
