OOP in JavaScript is a way of organizing code using classes and objects.

Imagine there is a bank and there's a form to create an account.
Many customers come and fill that form to create their account in that bank.
Bank doesn't create separate forms for each customer.
They make a template of that form, and it's same for all the customers.
For, example, a customer called Rohan fills a form. Now, it's Rohan's form.
Another guy called Bhuvan fills a form. Now, it's Bhuvan's form.

Here, the bank form template is the 'class' which is a blueprint for creating objects.
You write it once, and you can create n number of objects.

Here, Rohan's form and Bhuvan's form are 'objects'.
They are created from the blueprint of the bank form.

This is OOPS. But, how it's useful for devs in real life?

i. Without OOP Concepts, code for big projects becomes messy and fucking hell to maintain.
   But, if we use OOP, the code is organized, and easier to maintain.

ii. Makes team-work easier. Each dev can work on a different class.
    It prevents devs stepping on each other's toes.

iii. Debigging becomes easier as the code is organized.

iv. Helps the code to be long-term maintainable.
    When the application grows, new features should be addes.
    With OOP, it becomes easier to add new classes without breaking the code.

NOTE: Most of the people pronounce OOP as OOPS just because its easy.
But it's not correct, just like telling ATM machine.
We should know the difference, that's all.
