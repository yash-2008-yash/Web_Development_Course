OOP in JavaScript is a way of organizing code using classes and objects.
Programs become easier to maintain, scale, and understand with OOPS usage.

Imagine there is a bank and there's a form to create an account.
Many customers come and fill that form to create their account in that bank.
Bank doesn't create separate forms for each customer.
They make a template of that form, and it's same for all the customers.
For, example, a customer called Rohan fills a form. Now, it's Rohan's form.
Another guy called Bhuvan fills a form. Now, it's Bhuvan's form.

Here, the bank form template is the 'class' which is a blueprint for creating objects.
You write it once, and you can create n number of objects.

Here, Rohan's form and Bhuvan's form are 'objects'.
They are created from the blueprint of the bank form.

This is OOPS. But, how it's useful for devs in real life?

- Reusability of code
  
    If you create a User class once, you can make thousands of user objects without rewriting the same logic again and again. In big projects, this saves insane amounts of time.

- Makes debugging easier

    If something breaks, you will know exactly where to look because the code's well organized with OOPS.

- Makes team work effective

    In professional dev teams, different people work on different classes without stepping on each other's toes.

In short, OOPS gives us clean structure, reusability, scalability, and maintainability.
These are crucial in real-world applications like Web apps, Banking and Enterprise Systems, etc.

NOTE: We, people, pronounce it as OOPS, but it's OOP.
It became common among people pronouncing it as OOPS.
For example, people say "ATM Machine", which is wrong, but common.
So, just know the right thing, that's all.
