CommonJS is the old-school Node.js Module System.
ECMAScriptScript is the standard and modern Node.js Module System.

CommonJS Traits:
- Uses require() and module.exports
- Synchronous loading (loads when code runs)
- Default in older Node.js
- Works only in Node, not browsers

ECMAScript Traits:
- Uses import / export
- Static & asynchronous loading
- Works in browsers + Node.js
- Required for modern tools (React, Vite, Next.js, etc.)

We should learn both of them for mastering JS.
Because, CommonJS is used in legacy-code, which you come across in your job life.
ECMAScript is used in modern code, so we need to learn it mandatorily.

What you should use & when you should use:

Default export → when the file has one main thing
Named exports → when there are multiple utility files
