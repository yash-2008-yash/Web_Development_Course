Middleware is a function that is present between a user’s request and the final response in a server application.

In Express.js, middleware can:

- read or modify the request
- decide whether the request should continue
- stop it and send a response
- or pass control to the next step

A request doesn’t go straight to the page.
It passes through checkpoints (middleware).
Each checkpoint can inspect, allow, block, or change it.

function middleware(req, res, next) {
    console.log("Request received")
    next() // This means "move to the next step"
}

If next() is called, request continues. If not, request stops there.

REAL-WORLD USES:

- Login (or) Authentication checks
- Logging requests
- Validating form data
- Blocking unauthorized users

In simple terms, middleware controls what happens to a request before it reaches its final destination.
