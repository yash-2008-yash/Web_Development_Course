You have to write a Node.js program to clear the clutter inside a directory.
That means the program should organize the contents of that directory into different folders.

For example, imagine you have these files:

background.jpg
certificate.pdf
cover.jpg
document.pdf
files.zip
logo.png

This files should become organized like:

Inside the folder 'pdf', document.pdf and certificate.pdf should be stored.
Inside the folder 'jpg', background.jpg and cover.jpg should be stored.
Inside the folder 'zip', files.zip should be stored.
Inside the folder 'png', logo.png should be stored.

The JS program should do all these tasks. That's the exercise problem.
