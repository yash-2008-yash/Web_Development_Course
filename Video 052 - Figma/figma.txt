You might think HTML, CSS, JavaScript is enough to make good websites.
Nah, that's not the case.

We need to design the website before creating/developing the website.
In big-scale websites, designing is done before the actual development of the website.

That is, to make the website look more eye-appealing, we need to properly design it.
That's the job of website designer.

Figma is a tool which helps us to design the website.
With Figma, we can basically create a prototype of our website before developing it.

Imagine you made a website, working your ass off, and your client says "Nah, I don't like this."
It would feel absolutely bad. So, with Figma, we can create a prototype, ask our client whether they like it or not,
then we can develop the actual website.
