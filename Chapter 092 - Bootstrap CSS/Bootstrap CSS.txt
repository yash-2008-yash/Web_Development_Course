Bootstrap CSS is a popular front-end framework used to build responsive, mobile-first websites quickly and efficiently.
It provides ready-made CSS classes for layouts, buttons, forms, navigation bars, and more—so you don’t style everything from scratch.
Bootstrap uses a grid system that automatically adapts designs to different screen sizes.
In practice, it helps developers focus on functionality while maintaining a clean, professional UI.
