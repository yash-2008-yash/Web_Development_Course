Express.js is a web framework for Node.js.
It simplifies tasks like building servers, APIs, and backend applications by providing clean tools for handling routes, requests, responses, and middleware.

Developers wanted to use JS to make servers in the backend.
So, they introduced Node.js to do that.
But, using Node.js to make backend servers, it became too much time-consuming.
Thats's why Developers introduced Express.js to do what Node.js did, in less code.
